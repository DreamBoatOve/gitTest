I just modify sheets "table 2" and "abbreviations"
-------------------------------------------------------
1 In your appendix: all your full expression should be start with the capital letter
	Exp:
		Wrong:	"Al				aluminum"
		Right:	"Al				Aluminum"
2 About the table 2
	(from other reference) ???
		"(from other reference) " appears a few times in the table, what is it means?
	Col: "Applied Areas"
		This column is the main reason that keeped holding me off, and i still can not find a firmed support about the classification of 'Applied Areas'. So, i just quickly the references and ur choices and then make the decision about what to fill into the blank.
	Col: Experimental Environment
		I agreed on most of ur choices
	Col: Activation function
		Warning: you basically enumerate all the possible activiation functions in ur table 1. So, the content in the col "Activation function" should be one of those functions. but in the references, i do find that they just use 'sigmoid' to represent their activiation function, but in ur table 1, u have  Logistic(sigmoidal) and Hypertangent(sigmoidal), which is confusing to chose
	Col: Neural network model
		Warning: there are some NN containing more than one hidden layers, So, i add an Option "DNN", standing for "Deep neural network"
	Row 12: 
		This reference is still very confusing for me even after several times of reading, i leave it out for now and will check it later(marked it red)
		One thing i am certain is that current content in row 12 is not appropriate. There multiple kinds of amplitude loading conditions, not just the "constant amplitude loading"
	Row 22: 
		It is so funny that u copy few imgs to fill into the blanks rather than type it.
3 Abbreviations
	I added some abbreviations that u missed (mark in blue)
