just personal interest, u can ignore this
-------------------------------------------------------
Last time, I summarized the catgories of material properties, chemical (corrosion), mechanical (structural and tribology)
According to the titles of section 3.1.*, I suggest that we just use Plan 1: corrosion, mechanical (structural and tribology); Plan 2: corrosion, structural, and tribology.
Because there is only "corrosion" beneath "chemical", why do not directly use "corrosion"?

Unsupervised anomaly detection: both normal and anomalous samples exist in the dataset.   ****  
Model identifies normal or anomaly instances by analyzing the characters of clusters.
The models identify normal or anomaly instances by analyzing the characters of clusters.

-------------------------------------------------------
The logic of this paragraph is very confusing. I assume your original intension is to express that your paper covers a lot of materials, multiple NNs, some hybird NNs, and a few input ranking methods. I suggest to put a summary sentence at the head of this paragraph and add few transition words to orderly connect each part.

金属腐蚀还可按腐蚀环境分类，即分为化学介质腐蚀、大气介质腐蚀、海水介质腐蚀和土壤腐蚀等
大气腐蚀
海水腐蚀
土壤腐蚀
人体环境服饰

corrosion of metal materials can be classified by many standards. According to corrosion environment, metal corrosion can be classified as atmosphere, sea water, soil, etc.

atmosphere
sea water
soil
-------------------------------------------------------
I double checked the refers:
37 22
	atmosphere
38
	it is about the corrosion of concrete sewer, so it should belong to the soil
39
	the service environment does have high temperature (combustion, coal gasification, etc.). I believe that it still belongs to "atmosphere"
-------------------------------------------------------
It looks much better than the previous edition. But it still has some small flaws
-------------------------------------------------------
加一句：在哪些方面取得了比较好的效果，罗列一下，附近这几句现在的写法太泛泛了，没有实质内容

What is a proof load test?
http://www.spartaengineering.com/what-is-a-proof-load-test-and-when-is-it-required/
-------------------------------------------------------
The proof load test is to stretch a stick util a fracture happens. The used force when the stick breaks is called ultimate (tensile) strengthen that is the purpose/goal. Literally, you have to keep adding force and wait for the break happens, which will take comparatively long time and energy. So, image a situation that we can just use 30%-50% of the ultimate (tensile) strengthen (known by theoretical calculation) to predict the ultimate (tensile) strengthen, then a lot of time and energy will be saved. I think this is the purpose of these two refers (35, 72)

I just modify sheets "table 2" and "abbreviations"
1 In your appendix: all your full expression should be start with the capital letter
	Exp:
		Wrong:	"Al				aluminum"
		Right:	"Al				Aluminum"
2 About the table 2
	(from other reference) ???
		"(from other reference) " appears a few times in the table, what is it means?
	Col: "Applied Areas"
		This column is the main reason that keeped holding me off, and i still can not find a firmed support about the classification of 'Applied Areas'. So, i just quickly the references and ur choices and then make the decision about what to fill into the blank.
	Col: Experimental Environment
		I agreed on most of ur choices
	Col: Activation function
		Warning: you basically enumerate all the possible activiation functions in ur table 1. So, the content in the col "Activation function" should be one of those functions. but in the references, i do find that they just use 'sigmoid' to represent their activiation function, but in ur table 1, u have  Logistic(sigmoidal) and Hypertangent(sigmoidal), which is confusing to chose
	Col: Neural network model
		Warning: there are some NN containing more than one hidden layers, So, i add an Option "DNN", standing for "Deep neural network"
	Row 12: 
		This reference is still very confusing for me even after several times of reading, i leave it out for now and will check it later(marked it red)
		One thing i am certain is that current content in row 12 is not appropriate. There multiple kinds of amplitude loading conditions, not just the "constant amplitude loading"
	Row 22: 
		It is so funny that u copy few imgs to fill into the blanks rather than type it.

notes:
	1-The journal selection
		Currently, pro.Shi is looking for the approriate journal to submit. After the determination of the target journal, Phyu has to modify all the references mark like [12], [13] according to the requirment of the journal.
	2-Abbreviation of terminology
		2.1-if a terminology related with material science appears for the first time, you should give the full name of the terminology and its abbreviation, like time of exposure (TOE). When the terminology appears again, you just use its abbreviation.
		2.2-Currently, i just check the abbreviations you asked. And i can check the other left abbreviations in next step if u need me to.
	3-The classification of material properties (according to the usablity)
		Physical Property
			Thermal
		Chemistry Property
			Corrosion
		Mechanical Property
			Structural
			Tribological
	4- Add a table in Section 2.4 to replace your current Fig 3 to function as the classifications of all kinds of NN
		u can start to fill the table
	4-About the large table 2 used in the paper
		4.1- Apparently, each row need much more space, if u turn the layout of the page containing the table 2 into lateral, the table will looks much better. At present, it is painful just looking at it.
		to be honest, when i look into the table 2 and then find out it is impossible to modify them in one/two days. i need to find the paper and check the content. it require much more time. maybe, i will deliver my modification in a week.
		4.2- I highly recommand u prepare your a table in an excel, once you are certain about your content, then copy or insert the table into your paper

Instead, we are going to make a table 
-------------------------------------------------------
ANN was established for predicting corrosion in different corrosive environments such as atmosphere [28], water [29], sea [23], high temperature [30], and so on. as well as forecasting materials performance as failure forms of fatigue [31], crack [20], pitting [32], creep [33], flow stress [34], wear [35], elasticity [36], toughness and hardness [37], hot deformation behavior [38] [1], yield strength [39], ultimate strength [40], elongation to fracture [22], etc.

My purpose of this table is to let know the reader from one reference in which the authors chose what materials and it is used for where and which environment the experiment is carrying out to produce the required data for ANN...and which input variables are used to produce which output (that is one property of materials) by using which type of ANN.
